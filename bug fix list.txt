BUG TO DO LIST
----
1. When a held item overlaps with another item, if the held item is destroyed, the other item can't be selected. *SOLVED*
2. If cursor is moved while item description text is animating, partial text from the last item appears in the new item description. The correct behaviour should be for the text to disappear entirely after stopping the coroutine.
